# Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning for Programmers

Practice code I wrote for the chapters/problems in "Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning for Programmers"

The Chapters and their respective files are as follows:

Chapter 01 - Escape! Coding Your Way Out of a Paper Bag : ```Chp01-CodeYourWayOutOfPaperBag.py```

Chapter 02 - Decide! Find the Paper Bag : ```Chp02-FindingThePaperBag(DecisionTrees).py```
